Project goals:
	Set up of Kerberos KDC server.
	Set up of a service.
	The set up of Kerberos administrative server should be done manually, so I will not automate it.
	Change realm name

Steps:
	1. edit on the /etc/krb5.conf to add the domain to [domain_realm] and the logs.
	2. edit on /etc/hosts to configure the IP address.
	3. access kadmin.local.
	4. add admin_name/admin, set up a password chosen by the user.
	5. add users to their domain and set up their initial password.
	6. add the services if desired and propagate their keytab to the home directory.
	7. safely transfer the keytab to the service machine if wanted.
	8. IF the service is Apache2 HTTP, then:
		o Install mod-auth-gssapi
		o Configure the Apache2 files to use Kerberos

Future Goals:
	O Scalability: add more services along your way.
